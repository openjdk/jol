[![Actions Status: build](https://github.com/ljviz/ljv/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ljviz/ljv/actions?query=workflow%3A"build")

LJV is tool for visualizing Java data structures, using [Graphviz](http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html).

It was developed by John Hamer in 2004 and released under GNU GPL (see the [original project page](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~j-hamer/LJV.html)).

This project aims to upgrade this tool to modern Java and make it an open source library in the modern sence of the word.
