     * The example of object promotion.
     *
     * Once the object survives the garbage collections, it is getting
     * promoted to another generation. In this example, we can track
     * the addresses of the objects, as it changes over time.
     *
     * VM also needs to record the "age" (that is, the number of GC
     * cycles the object had survived) of the object somewhere, and
     * it is stored in mark word as well. See how particular mark word
     * bits change with each promotion.
