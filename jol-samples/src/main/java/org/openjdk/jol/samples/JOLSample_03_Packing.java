     * This is the example how VM packs the fields.
     *
     * JVMs pack the fields to minimize the memory footprint. Run
     * this example and see the fields are densely packed, and gaps
     * are minimal. It is achieved by aligning fields in 8->4->2->1
     * order, because it can not break the initial alignment, once we
     * align the 8-byte field. The gap resulted in the initial 8-byte
     * align can be taken by one or few smaller-sized fields.
     *
     * Note that the actual field order is very different from the
     * declared order. Nothing in the JVM spec requires otherwise.
